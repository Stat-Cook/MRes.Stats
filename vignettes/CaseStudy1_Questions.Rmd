# [Find the Answer: Dexamethasone in Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19](https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2021436)

# Questions:

Q: What is the primary outcome of the study?
A: The primary outcome of the study is the time to death
True: Time to death
False: Time to recovery
False: Likelihood to require ventilation
False: Readmission within 30 days

Q: What is the study design?
A: The study is a randomized, controlled trial that compares the effects of dexamethasone with standard care in hospitalized patients with Covid-19.
True: RCT
False: Observational study
False: Secondary analysis of data
False: Case study

Q: What was the treated sample size?
A: The study treated 2014 patients, having enrolled 6245 patients in total.
True: 2104 patients
False: 5000 patients
False: 9335 patients
False: 4321 patients


Q: What analysis was used to assess the primary outcome?
A: The primary outcome was assessed using a Cox proportional-hazards model, which compared the time to recovery between the dexamethasone group and the standard care group.
T: Cox proportional-hazards model
F: Logistic regression
F: ANOVA
F: Linear regression

Q: What subgroup analyses were performed?
A: 


Q: What were the results of the primary outcome?
A: The results showed that dexamethasone reduced the time to recovery compared to standard care.
T: Dexamethasone reduced mortality
F: Dexamethasone increased mortality
F: Dexamethasone icnreased time to recovery
F: Dexamethasone reduced time to recovery



Q: For which patients are dexmethasone recommended?
A: Dexamethasone is recommended for patients who are receiving respiratory support, including those on mechanical ventilation or oxygen therapy, as it was shown to reduce mortality in these groups.
T: Patients on mechanical ventilation or oxygen therapy
F: All hospitalized patients
F: Patients with severe Covid-19 symptoms only
F: Patients with mild Covid-19 symptoms

Q: For which patients is dexamethasone not recommended?
A: Dexamethasone is not recommended for patients who do not require respiratory support, as it did not show a benefit in this group and may even be harmful.  Or those who have other
contraindications for dexamethasone use.
T: Patients not requiring respiratory support
F: Patients with severe Covid-19 symptoms
F: Patients on mechanical ventilation
F: All patients with Covid-19


Q: How was randomization performed?
A: Randomization was performed using a computer-generated randomization sequence, which assigned patients to either the dexamethasone group or the standard care group.
T: Computer-generated randomization sequence
F: Block Randomization based on hospital ward
F: Randomization by patient preference
F: Stratified randomization by age

Q: What exclusions factors were applied?
A: Patients with either indication for, or contraindication to dexamethasone were excluded, 
and those being treated at sites without access to dexamethasone.
T: Patients with indication or contraindication to dexamethasone
T: Patients being treated at sites without access to dexamethasone
F: Patients with mild Covid-19 symptoms
F: Patients with severe Covid-19 symptoms only
