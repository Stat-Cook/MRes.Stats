</h3>
<p>Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It
is based on the concept of uncertainty, and describes the world as made
up of ‘random variables’. A ‘random variable’ differs from a ‘variable’
in that it is not a set value, but instead takes on different values
with different probabilities.</p>
<p>Probability is a language, so we need to define our terminology:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>random variable</em> is a variable that can take on different
values, each with a certain probability.</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(P(X = x)\)</span> refers to the
probability of the random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> taking on the value <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</li>
<li>The variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has an <em>event
space</em> (which is the set of all possible values it can take).</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(P(X=x)\)</span> is the probability of
the event <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> taking on the value
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and is between 0 and 1.</li>
<li>The sum of all probabilities in the event space is 1, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\sum P(X=x) = 1\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in the event space.</li>
<li>Two events are <em>mutually exclusive</em> if they cannot occur at
the same time</li>
<li>Two events are <em>independent</em> if the occurrence of one does
not affect the probability of the other occurring.</li>
</ul>
<p>The simplest example would be a single toss of a two sided coin. We
can define the random variable, <span class="math inline">\(CoinToss\)</span>, as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(CoinToss\)</span> has an event space of
<span class="math inline">\(\{Heads,~Tails\}\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P(CoinToss = Heads) = 0.5\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P(CoinToss = Tails) = 0.5\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>NB: as with many examples we are simplifying the natural world and
assuming the coin will never land on its edge, and that the coin is fair
(i.e., the two sides are equally likely).</p>
<p>As the events are <em>mutually exclusive</em> (i.e. the coin can’t be
heads and tails at the same time) we can we can say that the chance of
either occurring is the sum of the individual probabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P(CoinToss = \{Heads~or~Tails\}) =
P(CointToss = Heads) + P(CointToss = Tails) = 1\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If we were to do this experiment multiple times, we would expect to
see approximately half of the tosses being heads, and half being tails.
If we didn’t see this, we might question the fairness of the coin, or
the randomness of the toss.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="conditional-probability-distributions">Conditional probability distributions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#conditional-probability-distributions"></a>
</h3>
<p>In reality, random events can be affected by outside behaviours and
we might need to discuss the probability of an event <em>given</em> some
conditions. The probability of an event given some influencing factors
is written as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P(Event | Influence) \]</span></p>
<p>or read as the ‘probability of an event given the influence’.</p>
<p>For example, if we have a random variable <span class="math inline">\(Weather\)</span> with an event space of <span class="math inline">\(\{Sunny,~Rainy\}\)</span>, we might want to know
the probability of it being sunny given that it is summer:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P(Weather = Sunny | Season = Summer)
\]</span></p>
<p>This is a conditional probability distribution, and it describes the
probability of the event <span class="math inline">\(Weather =
Sunny\)</span> occurring, given that the condition <span class="math inline">\(Season = Summer\)</span> is true. To estimate this
probability, we could look at historical data to determine how often it
was <strong>Sunny</strong> and how often it was <strong>Summer</strong>,
with the conditional probability defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P(Weather = Sunny | Season = Summer) =
\frac{P(Weather = Sunny, Season = Summer)}{P(Season =
Summer)}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(P(Weather = Sunny, Season =
Summer\)</span> indicates that both have happened. Now, we might have a
data set of 1000 days - where it was <strong>Summer</strong> for 250
days and <em>Sunny</em> for 400 days, but <strong>Sunny</strong> and
<strong>Summer</strong> 200 only days. We’d hence say:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P(Weather = Sunny | Season = Summer) =
\frac{200}{250} = 0.8\]</span></p>
<p>Conditional probability gives rise to the formal definition of
<strong>independence</strong> as if an event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is independent of a factor <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> then:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P(A|B) = P(A) \]</span></p>
<p>If these are not true, then <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are associated, and by
measuring one we can draw inferences about the other. Though be aware
that just because <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is not
independent of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> in a study this
doesn’t mean that <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> causes <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="joint-probability-distributions">Joint probability distributions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#joint-probability-distributions"></a>
</h3>
<p>A joint probability distribution describes the probability of two or
more random variables occurring together. For example, if we have two
random variables, <span class="math inline">\(CoinToss1\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(CoinToss2\)</span>, the joint probability
distribution is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(CoinToss1 = a, CoinToss2 =
b)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are the possible outcomes, with an
event space of <span class="math inline">\(\{HH,~HT,~TH,~TT\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, we might assume that <span class="math inline">\(CoinToss1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(CoinToss2\)</span> are independent, meaning the
outcome of one does not affect the outcome of the other. By doing this,
we can calculate the probabilities of an outcome by multiplying together
the probabilities of the individual coins:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P(CoinToss1 = H, CoinToss2 = H) =
P(CoinToss1 = H) \times P(CoinToss2 = H) = 0.5 \times 0.5 =
0.25\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P(CoinToss1 = H, CoinToss2 = T) =
P(CoinToss1 = H) \times P(CoinToss2 = T) = 0.5 \times 0.5 =
0.25\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P(CoinToss1 = T, CoinToss2 = H) =
P(CoinToss1 = T) \times P(CoinToss2 = H) = 0.5 \times 0.5 =
0.25\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P(CoinToss1 = T, CoinToss2 = T) =
P(CoinToss1 = T) \times P(CoinToss2 = T) = 0.5 \times 0.5 =
0.25\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>As this is the full space of outcomes, the probabilities sum to
1.</p>
<p>If we were to do this experiment and not see these results, we might
question the independence of the coins, or the randomness of the tosses.
A large part of quantitative research is establishing if two events are
independent, or if we have evidence that they are related in some
way.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-probability-distribution">Types of Probability Distribution<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#types-of-probability-distribution"></a>
</h3>
<p>There are many types of probabiltiy distribution, but here we want to
introduce four common ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Empirical distribution</li>
<li>Binomial distribtuion</li>
<li>Normal distribution</li>
<li>Poisson distribution</li>
</ul>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="empirical-distribution">Empirical distribution<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#empirical-distribution"></a>
</h4>
<p>An empirical distribution is a probability distribution that is based
on observed data. It is a way of estimating the probability of an event
occurring based on historical data. Imagine a data set of student
heights, e.g 40 students, ranging from 150cm to 200cm. We could use the
data to answer questions like <span class="math inline">\(P(Height &gt;
180cm)\)</span> by counting the number of students who are taller than
180cm and dividing by the total number of students.</p>
<p>This is a simple way of estimating the probability of an event
occurring, and is often used in exploratory data analysis. It has the
advantage that it doesn’t make any assumptions about the form of the
data, but can lead to complex calculations, time consuming
calculations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="binomial-distribution">Binomial distribution<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#binomial-distribution"></a>
</h4>
<p>Early statisticians were often gamblers - and hence were interested
in how often they were likely to succeed in a game of chance. This led
to the development of the binomial distribution, which is used to model
the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, each
with the same probability of success. It is called the ‘binomial’
distribution because it describes situations with two outcomes, such as
success or failure, heads or tails, etc.</p>
<p>The binomial distribution is defined by two parameters: the number of
trials <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and the probability of
success <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. The probability of
getting exactly <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> successes in
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> trials is given by the
formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\binom{n}{k}\)</span> is the
binomial coefficient[ref]. The closer <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is to 0, there will be fewer successes,
whereas if it is closer to 1 there will be more successes.</p>
<p>For a given set of data, we might want to estimate <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and it’s error. One way to do this is
the *maxi</p>
<p>This is by calculating the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, which is the value of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> that maximizes the likelihood of the
observed data. The MLE of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is
given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \hat{p} = \frac{k}{n} \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the number of
successes and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of
trials. The error in the estimate can be calculated using the standard
error of the proportion:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ SE =
\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} \]</span></p>
<p>which gives us a measure of the uncertainty in our estimate of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="normal-distribution">Normal distribution<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#normal-distribution"></a>
</h4>
<p>The normal distribution (also called the Gaussian distribution, after
Carl Friedrich Gauss) is one of the most commonly used distributions in
statistics, called the <em>Normal</em> because of how wide spread it is.
It is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric about the
mean, and has a bell-shaped curve. The normal distribution is defined by
two parameters: the mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and
the standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>.</p>
<p>The mean describes the average location of the data, and the standard
deviation describes the spread of the data. If we have two data sets,
both described by the normal distribution and one has a higher mean than
the other, we can say that the data is on average larger. Similarly, is
one has a higher standard deviation than the other, we can say that the
data is more spread out.</p>
<p>The normal has a useful property relating the mean and standard
deviation. For a given distribution we can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>66% of the data to sit in the interval <span class="math inline">\(\mu - \sigma\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\mu + \sigma\)</span>
</li>
<li>95% of the data to sit in the interval <span class="math inline">\(\mu - 2\sigma\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\mu + 2\sigma\)</span>
</li>
<li>99% of the data to sit in the interval <span class="math inline">\(\mu - 3\sigma\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\mu + 3\sigma\)</span>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="poisson-distribution">Poisson distribution<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#poisson-distribution"></a>
</h4>
<p>Sometimes when we are looking at ‘successes’ or events - it is not
within a set number of attempts but instead within a set period of time.
For example, we might be interested in the number of emails received in
an hour, the number of cars passing a junction in a day, or how often
Prussian soldiers were accidentally killed due to being kicked by a
horse [Das Gesetz der kleinen Zahlen [The law of small numbers] (in
German). Leipzig, Germany: B.G. Teubner. pp. 1, 23–25.].</p>
<p>The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of independent
events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space,and is defined by
a single parameter <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, which
is the average rate of occurrence. A large value of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> implies a faster rate of events,
hence more observed events for an equivalent interval.</p>
<p>The probability of observing <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>
events in a fixed interval is given by the formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k
e^{-\lambda}}{k!} \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is the base of the
natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828), and <span class="math inline">\(k!\)</span> is the factorial of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<p>For a single set of data, we can approximate <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \hat{\lambda} = \frac{n}{T}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of events
observed and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is the total length
of intervals in which the events were observed. The error in the
estimate can be calculated using the standard error of the Poisson
distribution:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ SE = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{\lambda}}{T}}
\]</span></p>
<p>which is a measure of our uncertainty in the estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="exponential-distribution">Exponential distribution<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#exponential-distribution"></a>
</h3>
<p>Modelling how many events might happen is useful, but sometimes we
want to know how long will pass between events (e.g. time to failure in
a factory). There are multiple techniques for this but the simplest is
the ‘exponential’ distribution - which models the time to event. The
‘exponential’ distribution is described by a rate parameter, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> (the same as the rate of events),
as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P(T = t) = \lambda e^{-\lambda t}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is the time to the next
event, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the time elapsed, and
<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is the rate of events per
unit time. The exponential distribution is memoryless, meaning that the
probability of an event occurring in the next time interval is
independent of how much time has already passed.</p>
<p>A larger value of <span class="math inline">\(lambda\)</span> means a
faster rate of events, and hence a shorter time to the next event. A
smaller value of <span class="math inline">\(lambda\)</span> means a
slower rate of events, and hence a longer time to the next event.</p>
<p>This gives us a measure of the uncertainty in our estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>. Here we have omitted the
estimator for the exponential family, but details can be found at
[ref].</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="why-are-these-distributions-useful">Why are these distributions useful?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-are-these-distributions-useful"></a>
</h3>
<p>When we do quantitative research, we often want to make inferences
about a population based on a sample of data.<br>
Often, this means performing some form of ‘regression’ analysis
(i.e. fitting a model to the data) so that we can quantify if a given
variable is independent of our outcome allowing for other confounding
factors. It is the type of probability function that best describes our
outcome which decides what sort of regression model is most valid for
the data:</p>
<ul>
<li>An outcome described by the ‘Normal’ distribution might employ
‘Linear’ regression</li>
<li>An outcome described by the ‘Binomial’ distribution might employ
‘Binomial Logistic’ regression</li>
<li>An outcome described by the ‘Poisson’ distribution might employ
‘Poisson’ regression</li>
<li>An outcome described by the ‘Exponential’ distribution might employ
‘Exponential’ regression or a similar time-to-event analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>and so in turn if a study uses one of these methods, we should expect
the outcome to match.</p>
